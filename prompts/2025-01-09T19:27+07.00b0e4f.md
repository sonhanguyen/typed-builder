## Context
Working on a TypeScript framework for building LLM agents with dynamic planning capabilities. Started with an over-engineered system and simplified it significantly.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Architecture Simplification
- **Removed over-abstractions**: Risk assessment, resource management, optimization frameworks
- **Kept core value**: Dynamic planning that generates workflows from user goals
- **LangGraph integration**: Use mature execution engine instead of building custom one

### 2. Simplified Domain Model
**Final simplified interfaces:**
- `PlanningConstraints`: Just maxDuration, requiredCapabilities, excludedCapabilities  
- `ExecutionPlan`: goal, workflow, optional estimatedDuration
- `Task`: id, name, type, dependencies, parameters
- `Workflow`: id, tasks array with helper methods
- `Planner`: Single method `createPlan(goal, capabilities, constraints)`

### 3. Documentation Updated
- README.md: Focus on dynamic planning + LangGraph execution
- planning.md: Simplified to core concepts without complex optimization
- Removed references to resource management, risk assessment, monitoring

### 4. New Conceptual Direction Proposed
User suggested even cleaner domain model:
- **Agent**: Program with input/output, streaming, memory
- **LLMAgent**: Agent with LLM prompt, streams thoughts/tool calls  
- **Workflow**: Graph of tasks with dependencies
- **Task**: Execution unit (tool call or agent call)
- **Worker**: Resource-bound task executor

## Current State
- âœ… Simplified existing codebase to remove over-engineering
- âœ… Updated documentation to match simplified architecture  
- âœ… Committed changes (00b0e4f)
- ðŸš§ Ready to implement new conceptual model in next phase

## Next Steps
Implement Phase 1 of new domain model:
1. Core Agent abstraction with streaming
2. AgentMemory (session/persistent/history)
3. Task and Workflow structures  
4. Basic Worker with resource binding
5. LLMAgent with prompt-based execution

## Code Changes Summary
- Removed: 15+ complex interfaces related to optimization, risk, resources
- Simplified: Planning system to core workflow generation
- Streamlined: Task/Workflow to basic dependency management
- Updated: All documentation to reflect new architecture
- Result: ~667 lines removed, cleaner codebase focused on core value
