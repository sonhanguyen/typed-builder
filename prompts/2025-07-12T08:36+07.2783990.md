# Typed Builder Monorepo Refactoring

## Context
Started with a single-file agent system and evolved it into a distributed monorepo architecture.

## User Requests

### Initial Request
> notice i made the change in @agent.ts so that the agent's public interface is just a bidirectional channel. Refactor it so that a supervisor orchestrate's the queue connection to all agent, as well as distribute the task to appropriate one using the public interface and metadata. Get rid of the MessageQueue for the TaskResult, make it just an emitterCalled the Read tool with the following input: {"filePath":"/Users/harry/workspace/typed-builder/agent.ts"}

### Follow-up Changes
1. Renamed Supervisor to Router
2. Made executor a constructor parameter on agent
3. Changed agent to call the executor instead of abstract method
4. Made agent an interface with concrete AgentWorker and AgentProxy implementations
5. Created distributed architecture with Socket.IO pubsub

### Final Request
> ok now make this a bun monorepo with a ShellWorker and Router to be 2 separate projects, make the shared types top level

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent Interface Evolution
- Converted from abstract class to interface
- Made it a bidirectional channel: `Channel<Task | TaskResult, Task | TaskResult>`
- Removed MessageQueue dependency, replaced with direct emitters

### 2. Architecture Components
- **Agent Interface**: Bidirectional channel for tasks and results
- **AgentWorker**: Concrete implementation running on worker machines
- **AgentProxy**: Server-side proxy representing remote workers
- **Router**: Orchestrates task distribution based on executor type
- **Supervisor**: Manages worker connections and creates AgentProxy instances

### 3. Monorepo Structure
```

├── package.json (workspace root)
├── types.ts (shared types)
├── queue.ts (task queues)
├── packages/

│       │   ├── index.ts (ShellWorker)
│       │   └── cli.ts (CLI runner)
│       └── package.json
```

### 4. Key Features
- **Distributed Execution**: Workers connect via Socket.IO
- **Type Safety**: Shared types across projects
- **REST API**: Task submission and monitoring
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for worker-router communication
- **CLI Tools**: Easy deployment and management

### 5. Usage Flow
1. Router server starts and listens for connections
2. Shell workers connect and register with Supervisor
3. Supervisor creates AgentProxy instances for each worker
4. AgentProxy instances register with Router
5. Tasks submitted via API are routed to appropriate agents
6. Results flow back through the same channels

## Final Architecture
- **Server Side**: Router + Supervisor + AgentProxy instances
- **Worker Side**: ShellWorker with Socket.IO client
- **Communication**: Bidirectional Socket.IO channels
- **API**: REST endpoints for task submission and monitoring
- **Types**: Shared at monorepo root level

The system now supports distributed task execution with type safety and clean separation of concerns.
