# LLM Agent Interface with Complex Planning

(This log is missing the very first conversation when the initial interfaces and docs were created, then some changes on `agent.ts` were prompted but subsequentially scrapped. After this point, `AGENTS.md` was added with instructions for logging the conversations)

## Overview
This conversation documents the development of TypeScript interfaces for an agent system based on documentation, and exploration of workflow management systems.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Agent Interface Creation

**Task**: Read `@docs/agent.md` and recreate the interfaces

**Interfaces Created** (`src/types/agent.ts`):
- `AgentCapability` - defines agent skills and functions
- `AgentContext` - runtime environment for agents  
- `AgentMemory` - multi-layered memory system (short-term, long-term, episodic)
- `AgentEpisode` - complete interaction sequences
- `AgentAction` - individual agent actions with status tracking
- `ActionStatus` enum - action lifecycle states
- `AgentOutcome` - results of episodes/actions
- `LLMAgent` - main agent interface with planning, execution, and management capabilities

### 2. Interface Design Issues Identified

**Issue 1**: Execute method return type
- **Problem**: Why does `execute` not return an `executionId`?
- **Solution**: Changed `execute(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<ExecutionResult>` to `execute(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<string>` to return execution ID immediately

**Issue 2**: Missing result retrieval method
- **Problem**: If `execute` returns only ID, how to get the final `ExecutionResult`?
- **Solution**: Added `getResult(executionId: string): ExecutionResult | undefined` method to `LLMAgent` interface

### 3. Workflow System Architecture

**Relationship Clarification**:
- **Workflow**: Reusable template/blueprint (like a recipe)
- **Plan**: Specific instance using a workflow with concrete parameters (meal plan with recipe + constraints)
- **Execution**: Actual runtime execution of a plan (cooking the meal)

**Flow**: `Workflow (template) → ExecutionPlan (strategy + workflow + constraints) → ExecutionResult (actual execution instance)`

### 4. Workflow Documentation Enhancement

**Task**: Add missing example for loop in `workflow.md`

**Added**: Loop workflow example showing:
- Loop Task with `TaskType.LOOP`
- Loop Parameters: condition, maxIterations, batchOperation, onEachIteration
- Practical batch data processing use case

### 5. Workflow DSL Research

**Question**: Existing workflow DSLs that resemble this system

**Serializable Options Identified**:
1. **AWS Step Functions** - JSON state machines with Choice, Parallel, Map states
2. **GitHub Actions** - YAML workflows with jobs, dependencies, conditions  
3. **Argo Workflows** - YAML/JSON DAGs with dependencies, loops, conditionals
4. **Azure Logic Apps** - JSON workflow definitions
5. **Tekton Pipelines** - YAML-based with tasks and dependencies

### 6. AWS Step Functions Analysis

**AWS-Specific Elements**:
- `Resource` field with ARN format
- `Credentials` with IAM roles
- AWS CloudWatch integration
- AWS-specific error codes

**Generic/Portable Elements**:
- State types: `Task`, `Choice`, `Parallel`, `Map`, `Wait`, `Pass`, `Succeed`, `Fail`
- Control flow: `Next`, `End`, `Default`
- Conditions and boolean logic
- Variable passing: `InputPath`, `OutputPath`, `ResultPath`
- Retry/Catch mechanisms

**Conclusion**: Core workflow structure is quite portable

### 7. Step Functions Parsing Libraries

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
- `@aws-sdk/client-sfn` - ASL JSON parser
- `asl-validator` - ASL syntax validator
- `stepfunctions-local` - Local emulator

**Python**:
- `amazon-states-language-asl-validator`
- `stepfunctions` - AWS SDK
- `localstack` - AWS emulator

**Multi-language**:
- `localstack/localstack` - Open source AWS emulator
- `conductor` - Netflix's workflow engine

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Execute Method Design**: Return execution ID immediately for async tracking
2. **Result Retrieval**: Add dedicated `getResult()` method for final results
3. **Memory System**: Multi-layered approach (short-term, long-term, episodic)
4. **Workflow Documentation**: Enhanced with practical loop example
5. **DSL Strategy**: Consider AWS Step Functions ASL as foundation for portable workflow DSL

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `/src/types/agent.ts`
   - Complete agent system interfaces
   - Proper async execution patterns
   - Memory management interfaces

2. **Modified**: `/docs/workflow.md`
   - Added loop workflow example
   - Batch processing use case demonstration

## Technical Insights

### Agent System Architecture
- Modular, capability-based design
- Separation of planning, execution, and monitoring
- Comprehensive memory management
- Event-driven architecture

### Workflow Design Patterns
- DAG-based task dependencies  
- Multiple execution types (sequential, parallel, conditional, loop)
- Comprehensive validation and monitoring
- Resource-aware execution

### Integration Considerations
- Planning system creates execution plans with workflows
- Execution engine handles runtime execution
- Monitoring provides real-time feedback
- Agent interfaces tie everything together

This conversation demonstrates iterative interface design, identifying and resolving design issues, and researching existing solutions for workflow management systems.
