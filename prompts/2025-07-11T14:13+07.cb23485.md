# Checkpoint: Domain Model Redesign

## Context
Starting from a dynamic agent planning framework, we've completely redesigned the domain models to focus on streaming execution units and resource management.

## User Request
The user wanted to take a step back and look at the overall domain models. They provided their conceptually desired components:

- **Agent**: A piece of program with input/output streams and optional memory
- **LLM Agent**: Agent with LLM prompt as input, streaming thoughts and tool calls
- **Workflow**: Graph of tasks with dependencies, executed by agents
- **Task**: Execution unit with dependencies, can be tool call or agent call
- **Worker**: Executes tasks, tied to resources (browser, sandbox, etc.)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Agent Interface Redesign
```typescript
export interface Agent<
  In extends NamedParams = {},
  Out = any,
  Event extends {} = {},
  Signal = any,
> extends Runnable<In, AsyncGenerator<Event, Out, Signal>> {
  id: string
  name: string
}
```

- Removed memory components (user requested simplification)
- Added streaming I/O using AsyncGenerator
- Event/Signal model for bidirectional communication
- LLM agents emit thoughts and tool calls, receive tool call results

### 2. Task and Workflow Redesign
```typescript
export interface Task<
  In extends NamedParams = {},
  Out = any
> extends Runnable<In, Promise<Out>> {
  id: string
  name: string
  resourceRequirements: ResourceRequirement[]
}

export interface Workflow<T extends Record<string, NamedParams> = {}> {
  id: string
  name: string
  tasks: {
    [K in keyof T]: TaskDefinition<T[K]> & {
      dependencies: (keyof T)[]
    }
  }
  // No execute method - workflows are passive
}
```

- Tasks specify resource requirements
- Workflows are passive definitions (no self-execution)
- Type-safe dependency management

### 3. Worker and Resource System
```typescript
export interface Worker<ResourceType extends Resource = Resource> {
  id: string
  name: string
  resources: ResourceType[]
  canExecute(task: Task): boolean
  execute<T extends Task>(task: T): Promise<Awaited<ReturnType<T['run']>>>
}

export interface Resource {
  id: string
  type: string
  status: 'available' | 'busy' | 'offline'
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

- Workers are explicitly bound to resources
- Concrete resource types (Browser, Sandbox, LLM)
- Resource availability tracking

### 4. Job Management
```typescript
export interface Job {
  id: string
  agentId: string
  status: JobStatus
  stream(): AsyncGenerator<AgentOutput, AgentOutput, AgentEvent>
  cancel(): Promise<void>
}

export interface AgentOrchestrator {
  createJob(agent: Agent, input: AgentInput): Promise<Job>
  getJob(jobId: string): Job | null
  cancelJob(jobId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

- Jobs represent running agent instances
- Orchestrator manages job lifecycle
- Separation of concerns: agents execute, orchestrators manage

## Design Philosophy Evolution

### From: Dynamic Planning Framework
- LangGraph integration focused
- Capability-based design
- Complex memory management
- Planning-centric architecture

### To: Streaming Execution Units
- Stream-first architecture
- Resource-aware execution
- Composable by design
- Event-driven communication

## Analysis Documents Created

1. **agent-design-critique.md**: Detailed critique of the user's agent interface design with LLM implementation examples
2. **execution-units-critique.md**: Analysis focusing on Agent/Task as execution units with Worker/Resource separation
3. **one-resource-per-worker-analysis.md**: Trade-off analysis of one-to-one vs one-to-many resource-worker relationships

## Current Status
- Core domain models redesigned and implemented
- Type-safe interfaces with generic constraints
- Clear separation of concerns (orchestration vs execution)
- Comprehensive analysis of design trade-offs
- Ready for implementation of concrete classes

## Next Steps
The domain models are now aligned with the user's vision. The next logical steps would be:
1. Implement concrete agent classes
2. Build execution engine
3. Create worker implementations
4. Develop resource management system
5. Add error handling and monitoring

## Key Design Decisions
- **Streaming First**: All agent execution is AsyncGenerator-based
- **Resource Explicit**: Tasks declare resource requirements, workers manage resources
- **Passive Workflows**: Workflows are definitions, agents execute them
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript generics throughout
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Event/Signal model for complex interactions
